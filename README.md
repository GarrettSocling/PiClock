# PiClock

!WARNING this thing is under heavy construction!

Hi there,
this is a Clock made with a Raspberry Pi!

sorry its not well commented yet, i'm still working on it.

# Requiremnts 

You have to compile the project on your R-Pi (or your can crosscompile on your machine, 
but I think it is not worth it)

You need Qt to compile it.

*installation commands comming soon*

- qmake 
- make
- ./PiClock

to play Music you need to install Mopidy ( https://www.mopidy.com/ ). You can play your own mp3 files, webstreams or connect to spotify, SoundCloud or GooglePlay.

feel free to make some feature requests or bugreports!

here some pictures for you.
